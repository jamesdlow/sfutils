<body bgcolor="white">

<p>Provides classes that model the logical objects involved in the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> file release process.  A full and
detailed discussion of the process can be found in the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&group_id=1">Guide
to the SourceForge.net File Release System (FRS)</a>, but a quick summary is
given below.</p>

<p>I heartily recommend that you explore the SourceForge File Release System
user interface extensively before you attempt to use these classes so that you
fully understand what is going on behind the scenes.  The user interface is not
particularly straightforward, and the structure of the elements involved is not
apparent to all users.</p>

<h3>SourceForge File Release System: Structural Overview</h3>

<img src="doc-files/frs.gif" align="left"/>

<p>This is a brief summary of the structure of the elements involved in
releasing a file or group of files to SourceForge.  A UML representation of this
structure--not of the Java objects in this package--is visible to the left (for
those browsers which support the display of images).</p>

<p>The SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">site</a> is a vast and
sprawling network of <b><i>projects</i></b>, which are spaces carved out by
their owners for some combination of development work, web hosting and project
management functions.  Every project has an <b><i>administrator</i></b> who is
responsible for organizing the project and maintaining the users, files,
permissions, databases and other artifacts associated with it.  Projects are
modeled by the {@link sfutils.Project} class.  Their administrators are
modeled by the {@link sfutils.Administrator} class.</p>

<p>Each project is subdivided into one or more <b><i>packages</i></b>, which
really don't show up in any meaningful way until a project administrator (or
some other authorized project member) decides to release files (in fact, that's
the only point at which a project member can define new packages).  A package at
the most abstract level is simply a way to group meaningful work within a
project.  More pragmatically, it is a way of grouping groups of released files
together in a meaningful way.  Packages may be old, outdated, private or
experimental, in which case they are <b><i>hidden</i></b>, or they may be
suitable for public consumption, in which case they are <b><i>active</i></b>.
Packages are modeled by the {@link sfutils.frs.Package} class.</p>

<p>Finally, a package may have zero or more <b><i>file releases</i></b>
associated with it.  A file release is the basic unit of public currency on
SourceForge; it is what a project produces, and what that project's members
intend for the public to use and improve.  A file release may be
<b><i>hidden</i></b> or <b><i>active</i></b>, and has a <b><i>release
date</i></b>.  A file release will usually contain only one file--usually in
some archive format--but may contain many.  Each file in the file release must
be assigned a <b><i>file type</i></b> and a
<b><i>target architecture</i></b>.  Additionally, the SourceForge user interface
implies that a file <i>within</i> a file release may also have a release date.
However, actually <i>setting</i> such a release date doesn't seem to have any
effect on the SourceForge file release system.  File releases are modeled by the
{@link sfutils.frs.FileRelease} class, and files contained in a file release are
modeled by the {@link sfutils.frs.FileSpecification} class.</p>

<p>A file release is always associated with a <b><i>change log</i></b> and a set
of <b><i>release notes</i></b>.  The change log and the release notes together
describe the file release.</p>

<p>When you make a file release, you can choose to notify anyone who is
monitoring your project that the release has happened.  SourceForge's internal
mechanisms take care of the gory details and ensures that these users are
notified by email.</p>

<p>File releases may be made for any reason, at any time, by any member of the
project who has the required permissions.  A file release on SourceForge is
always intended for public consumption, and should be documented well enough
that prospective end users can figure out how to use it easily.  However, take
care when making a file release as the intent of the good folks at SourceForge
is that all file releases on their system live forever.  <strong>There is no
accessible mechanism on the SourceForge site to remove file releases.</strong>
The best you can do is to set a file release's visibility status to
<code>Hidden</code>.  Usually you'll want to hide its enclosing package as well,
but note that you cannot hide a package unless all the file releases it contains
are hidden as well.</p>

<h3>Design Notes</h3>

<p>I ran into some issues interfacing to the SourceForge File Release System web
interface programmatically.  Some of these issues are detailed below.

<ul>

<li>It looks like the file-within-a-file-release concept predates the file
release concept.  Both files-in-a-file-release and file releases have release
dates, but a file-within-a-file-release's release date
does not actually show up in the "Files" section of a project.</li>

<li>It is possible to confuse the File Release System by playing around with the
visibility statuses of both file releases and packages.  This package attempts
to prevent such confusion.</li>

<li>File releases, in general, are not to be undertaken lightly.  A file release
will be available to the public until a project administrator hides it
explicitly.  Consequently, test your file releases with care.</li>

<li>There is no enforced relationship on SourceForge between a file release and
any CVS tags that logically relate to it.  This package does not establish this
kind of link either.</li>

<li>Certain classes in the <code>sfutils</code> package (like {@link
sfutils.Project}, {@link sfutils.Administrator}, etc.) may be expanded
at a later date to provide a more complete model of the SourceForge site
structure.  For now, they contain only what is necessary to supply to the web
interface.</li>

</ul>
