<p>Provides classes that interact with the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> file release system website.  A
detailed discussion of the process can be found in the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&group_id=1">Guide
to the SourceForge.net File Release System (FRS)</a>.</p>

<p>I heartily recommend that you explore the SourceForge File Release System
user interface extensively before you attempt to use these classes so that you
fully understand what is going on behind the scenes.  The user interface is not
particularly straightforward, and the structure of the elements involved is not
apparent to all users.</p>
