Welcome to the SourceForge Utilities project!

To get started, please point your web browser at the index.html file in the docs
directory, which contains the full documentation for this project.  The full
documentation of the latest release is also online at
http://sfutils.sourceforge.net/, although bear in mind this may or may not match
the version that you've downloaded.

As mentioned elsewhere in the documentation, you'll need the Java 2 Standard
Edition Development Kit, version 1.4 or later, in order to build and/or run this
project.  The project itself is built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org/).
At the time of release, I used Maven version b9.

The SourceForge Utilities project relies heavily upon Russell Gold's excellent
HttpUnit product which lives at http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/.  You should
find the necessary libraries have been included in this distribution for you.

Thanks, as always, to the wonderful SourceForge team and their indispensable
site.

Happy SourceForging,
Laird J. Nelson
